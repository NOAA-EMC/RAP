Release Notes:  RAP v5.0.12

v5.0.12 - released March 9, 2022
* Crisis fix to address two issues related to the smoke and cloud pre-processing jobs.  
   * The current RAP smoke is missing all of the MODIS detections due to the upstream MODIS file name convention change.  A source code change is required to read in the correct files.
   * When processing NASA cloud observations, the code first reads in the observation time.  The time is a 32-bit integer, and starting with the beginning of 2022, the integer lies outside the range of values that 32-bit can represent, resulting in the NASA cloud products not being used.  To fix the issue, several integers are changed from 32-bit to 64-bit so the observation time is correctly represented.
