Release Notes: RAP v5.1.11

v5.1.11 - released July 7, 2023
* Source code changes to address an operational crash in the HRRR Alaska smoke processing.
   * With the recent addition of AF-Iband VIIRS data to the real-time operational runs, itÂ’s likely that more FRP points will be detected at each gridpoint, which was the underlying reason for the crash.  In the smoke processing code, there is a hardwired cap of 20 detections, and with this code fix the loop will be skipped if the number of detections is greater than 20.
   * Included with these changes to the RAP smoke processing are similar changes to the HRRR Alaska and HRRR CONUS smoke processing.
