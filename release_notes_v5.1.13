Release Notes: RAP v5.1.13

v5.1.13 - released August 14, 2023
* Source code changes to address an operational crash in the RAP forecast job.
   * With the recent addition of AF-Iband VIIRS data to the real-time operational runs, small fires with very low FRP are being ingested into the model.  This code fix is for the initialization of the parameters to run the fire plumerise code.  It resolves the operational crash and does not affect the results.
